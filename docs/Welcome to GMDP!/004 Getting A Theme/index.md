You can get custom themes by looking for some online. A theme usually will consist of a .pck file which contains all of the theme's assets. 

After you get your theme, put the pck file in the "themes" folder where the application is located. If the folder does not exist, create it. After this, restart the app, and the new theme should appear in the themes tab.
