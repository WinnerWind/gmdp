GMDP is an application that turns markdown files into presentations. In short, you type a markdown file and you can immediately begin presenting it. It is much faster than writing an entire PowerPoint Presentation or an entire Libreoffice Impress presentation from scratch. You can even pick and choose themes from the themes tab!

GMDP supports the following features
[ul]
Headers
Subheadings
Images
Footers
A presentation view
Exporting your presentation as images
Importing/Exporting your text content
[/ul]

If this is your first time with GMDP, start by reading the "Your First Presentation" document in the left.
