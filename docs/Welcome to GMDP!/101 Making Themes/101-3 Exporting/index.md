After making your beautiful theme, you might want to export it so that you can share it with friends.

[ol]
Go to Project > Export
Create a new preset with the Add... button.
Select your platform, though it shouldn't really matter.
Select the newly created preset and go to the Resources tab. 
Change export mode to "Export selected resources (and dependencies)"
Check ONLY the folder of your theme. Do NOT select the entire templates folder.
In "Filters to export non-resource files/folders", add *.ini. This is required to export the meta.ini file.
De-select "Runnable"
Export your pck file by clicking Export PCK/ZIP. Select PCK and not ZIP.
