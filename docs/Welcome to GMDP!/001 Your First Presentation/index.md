Most (common) presentations follow a simple formula.
[ol]
A title card
The main content (spanning several slides)
A "thank you" slide
[/ol]

Although some presentations may demand things like graphs and citations, we're going to attempt to write a presentation, proposing a new school club

P.S. This is intended to be a hands on tutorial. You can access this page from the help button at any time.

1. Go to the Edit tab and type in:
[code]
# Photography Club
## Your Name and co.
[/code]
This creates the first title card for our page.

2. Pages in GMDP are split using three hyphens ( --- ). Insert a page split to start composing your second page.
3. For our second page, we should probably tell the reader what our club is about.
[code]    
# About the Club
Our club is intended to teach elementary photography skills. We aim to teach composition, lighting, and getting off the dreaded 'auto mode' so that beginners can snap photos from day one. 
We want to provide a supportive place for people to both take and showcase their photographs in front of their fellow peers. 
[/code]

4. Insert another page split to start composing the third page.
[code]
# Who Should Join?
## Who are we targetting? Who's our target audience?
We want to target all members of the student body. As shown through recent polls, many students have demanded for a photography club since the start of the school year.
-# You can find the link to the school poll conducted in your inbox.
[/code]

5. Split the page again and create the thank you page. We'll keep it simple and just include a simple "thank you".
[code]
# Thank you!
[/code]

All in all, your presentation's source should look a bit like this:
[code]
# Photography Club
## Your Name and co.

In this way, we have learnt about Headings (lines prefixed with a #), Subheadings (lines prefixed with a ##), footers (lines prefixed with a -#) and even splitting pages.
